{"name":"ControlKeys","tagline":"Powerful keyboard customization made easy.","body":"ControlKeys\r\n===========\r\n\r\nControlKeys is a keyboard customization utility based on [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner).  If you are unfamiliar with Karabiner, you should check it out first.\r\n\r\nWhat's wrong with Karabiner?\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nNothing is wrong with Karabiner.  It's a very impressive, very powerful, and very useful utility.\r\n\r\nWhy did you fork Karabiner, then?\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nKarabiner offers *a huge number* of options built-in, many of which I do not find useful.  I wanted to clean up the interface and offer only what I see as the best options.  Because Karabiner (and therefore ControlKeys) is so flexible that it allows the end user to create any customizations they want, it is not necessary to build them all into the utility.  I believe many of them would be a better fit for a wiki or some other repository of customization XML files.\r\n\r\nWhy rename your fork?  Why not just fork it and contribute back to the original project?\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBecause my goals are different.  If I write anything useful to Karabiner, I'd be thrilled to have them adopt my changes.  But many of my changes are probably not interesting to them.  All changes that I think may be interesting are intended to go in the branch named `karabiner`.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
